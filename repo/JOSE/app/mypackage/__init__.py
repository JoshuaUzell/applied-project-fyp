''' The __init__.py file is a special file in Python that is used to mark a directory as a Python package. 
When a directory contains an __init__.py file, Python treats it as a package, which means that it can be imported as a module.
In this specific case, the __init__.py file is located in the mypackage directory, which means that mypackage is a Python package. 
The file itself may or may not contain any code, but its presence is what makes the directory a package. '''

# Example of __init__.py

# Initialization code (optional)
# print("Initializing mypackage")

# List of modules to import when using 'from mypackage import *'
# __all__ = ['module1', 'module2']

''' In this example, the __init__.py file may contain initialization code (printing a message in this case) and defines the __all__ variable to specify which modules should be imported when using from mypackage import *. '''
