**Brief Description:**
A carpooling app designed for students that facilitates rides to and from college. Users can either offer rides to other students or take a ride that's being offered. The goal for this project is to create an app that offers a convenient alternative to transportation, whilst also allowing people to meet other students on campus that they wouldn't have met before elsewhere.

## Key Features
1. Login + Registration to application.
2. User can register as driver with valid driver credentials.
3. Drivers can create a ride to a location.
4. User get a list of rides either coming from or going to college.
5. User can check out details on the driver such as their name, personality traits and etc.
6. Users can "request" to take this ride.

## Install Software
### Vs Code
Go to the Visual Studio Code Site. Then click 'Download for Windows' or click on the drop down to select another Operating System. Once the file is downloaded, go through the installation steps and the Visual Studio Code will be ready to go.

### Angular
To install Angular, make sure that Node.js and the Node package manager is installed in order to use Angular and any of its dependencies. After that a developer can globally install the Angular CLI onto their machine using the following command 'npm install -g @angular/cli'. A developer can then create a new project using the command 'ng new project-name' where the 'project-name' part can be replaced by any name the developer wants for their project. There will then be a series of questions on how a developer would want to set up their project using features like Angular routing. After this initial setup, a developer can then 'cd' into the newly created project directory and simply run the 'ng serve' command to run their application on a local development server.

### Ionic
To install Ionic, first it is required that the Node Package Manager is installed in order to run the 'npm' command that allows a user to install the Ionic CLI and also any other important project dependencies. Upon doing that, the user can then install Ionic using the command 'npm install -g @ionic/cli' to install the Ionic CLI globally, making it available in any directory where they want to start a new application. 
Upon completing this, a user can start a new project by doing the following command 'ionic start'. After inserting this command, Ionic will ask a series of questions such as what pre-made template a user wants to use. The choices are 'blank', 'tabs' or 'sidemenu'. Then a user will be asked if they want to install Capacitor for native mobile development. Upon answering these questions, their ionic project will be created in a new directory. A user must simply 'cd' into that directory and then run the 'ionic serve' command to run their application on a web

### Other Libraries
1. UUID - used to generate a universally unique identifier. Use the command "npm i --save-dev @types/uuid" to install the library.

Once all the necessary software has been downloaded, click on the 'code' button and download the contents of the repo onto your machine. On your machine, open up the project in Visual Studio Code and open up the built in terminal. Make sure you are in the 'fypProject' directory of the project and type in 'ionic serve' to run the application on a local server.
