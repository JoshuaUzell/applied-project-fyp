**Brief Description:**
A carpooling app designed for students that facilitates rides to and from college. Users can either offer rides to other students or take a ride that's being offered. The goal for this project is to create an app that offers a convenient alternative to transportation, whilst also allowing people to meet other students on campus that they wouldn't have met before elsewhere.
